🩺 Diabetes Predictor using Machine Learning & Tkinter
This project is a Diabetes Prediction System built using Python, Machine Learning (SVM), and a Tkinter GUI.
 It uses the popular PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset to train an SVM classifier, which predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical input values.
 
🚀 Features
Machine Learning model using Support Vector Classifier (Linear Kernel)
Data standardization using StandardScaler
Tkinter GUI for easy user input
Real-time diabetes prediction
Clean interface with background images/icons

🧠 How the Model Works
Reads the diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv)
Splits the data into training & testing sets
Applies StandardScaler for normalization
Trains an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier
Takes real-time user input from GUI
Predicts diabetic / non-diabetic condition
